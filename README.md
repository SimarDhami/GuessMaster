Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ¯

This Number Guessing Game is a simple Python script where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The script provides feedback on whether the guessed number should be higher or lower until the user guesses correctly.

How It Works

- Number Generation: The script generates a random number n between 1 and 100 using the random.randint() function.
- User Input: The user is prompted to guess the number.
- Feedback Loop:
--If the guessed number is higher than the target, the user is instructed to guess a lower number.
-- If the guessed number is lower than the target, the user is instructed to guess a higher number.

- Attempt Count: The number of attempts is tracked.
- Completion: Once the user guesses the correct number, the script displays the number of attempts taken.
